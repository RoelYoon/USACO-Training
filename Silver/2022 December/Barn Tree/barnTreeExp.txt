Graph Ad-Hoc / DP Solution. Average O(n)

I address two kinds of cases very differently. 
Case 1: 
The "normal" case where the given graph does NOT satisfy the property that vi = vi + 1.
The algorithm first looks at the leaves of the tree and 

Case 2: 
The graph is a linear doubly-linked list. Though this case may be solved using the normal 
method, it causes the worst-time time complexity and times out in some cases like test cases
9 and 10, so I designed a completely new algorithm for this case.
