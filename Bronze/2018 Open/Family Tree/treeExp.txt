Graph solution. O(n)
Construct a tree containing nodes of the following form:
struct Cow{
    string name;
    Cow* parent;
    unordered_set<string> children;
}

This tree structure allows us to determine any family relationships using simple algorithms.

The sibling check can be performed in O(1) by simply following one parent pointer and searching
the set of the parent's children. 

The parent check is essentially a linked list traversal up the parent pointers. 

The aunt check is the same as the parent check traversal except it checks the children set at 
each level. 

In the case that all of these checks are false, do one DFS from the root node of the tree
to determine if the two cows are even in the same tree. If they are, then they are related and
hence are cousins. If not, they are simply not related. 

The code length could be significantly reduced, but I will just leave it since it works.
