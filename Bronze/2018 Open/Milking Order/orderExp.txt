Greedy solution. O(n+m)

Place all the given k cow positions first. Then find placements for the cows in the heirarchy greedily by
placing them as far to the right as possible (while taking already-placed cows into consideration).

If cow 1 is not in the heirarchy, the problem is already solved by simply finding the left-most free space
in the line. However, the problem becomes more complicated if cow 1 is included in the heirarchy. Then, 
we have done the opposite of what we wantâ€”we have placed cow 1 in the right-most position possible. 

In this case, we must recalculate the positons of cow 1 and all the cows below cow 1 in the heirarchy. 
The same greedy algorithm from before can be modified to place these cows as far to the left as
possible (remember to watch out for the "locked" cows which must be placed where they are currently placed).
