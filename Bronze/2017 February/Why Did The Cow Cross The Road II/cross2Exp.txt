Ad-hoc solution. O(1).

Let a1 and a2 be the crossing points of some cow A and let b1 and b2 be the crossing points of some cow B.
Observe that cows A and B must be crossing pairs if their crossing points come in any rotated order of 
(a1, b1, a2, b2).

Above pattern regex notation:
^(?!.*(?:a1[^b1]|b1[^a2]|a2[^b2]|b2[^a1]))\d{4}$

For each cow, identify the two crossing points. Then do one clockwise traversal and one counterclockwise 
traversal between the points. In each traversal, mark any letters you come across only ONCE as a pair.
If you across the same letter twice, it is not a pair. Count the pairs you found, and record each found pair
so that they are not counted twice.
