Ad-hoc solution. O(n*logn)

Sort the cows by their arrival times. This has the same effect as inserting all the cows
into a priority queue. 

Traverse through the cows in order. If a cow's arrival time is higher than the current time variable,
we "skip" the time to the cow's arrival time. Then, add the cow's time spent answering questions to 
the time variable.
