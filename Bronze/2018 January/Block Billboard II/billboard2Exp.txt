Simple geometry solution. O(1)

Find the width & height of the intersection rectangle between the two billboards.

Observe that in the case that either the width or height of this intersection matches that of
the lawnmower billboard, we can eliminate the area of the intersection from the total area 
needed. In every other case, the total area of the tarp needed is the whole area of the lawnmower 
billboard. 

There is only one edge case where this observation no longer holds: when the feed billboard
partitions the view of the lawnmower billboard into two separate rectangles. In this case,
the whole area of the lawnmower billboard is still needed even if the width or height matches.
