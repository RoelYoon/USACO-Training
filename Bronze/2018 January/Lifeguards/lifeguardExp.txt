Brute force solution. O(n^2)

Simulate "firing" each lifeguard, and calculate the coverage times. Find the maximum among
these coverage times. 

You can calculate the coverage time given a set of shifts of lifeguards by sweeping over
the time points in O(n) (O(n*logn) for initially sorting). Do this sweep calculation for 
every possible set of shifts of lifeguards after firing exactly one lifeguard.
