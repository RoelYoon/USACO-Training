Ad-hoc solution. O(n*logn)

Create a mapping of each position to its "origin position"â€”the position from which a cow must have shuffled from exactly 
one shuffle ago O(n). 

Maintain a mapping of each cow to its position. Iterate through each cow and update its position to the origin position
of its current position. Repeat this three times O(3*n).

Now, simply sort the cows by their position O(n*logn) then print them in order.
