Simulation solution. O(n*logn).

Sort the logs chronologically (n*logn process), then simulate the changes recorded in the log
in order. After updating the cow's production, update the current display according to the 
rules described in the problem. Finally, check if the display changed from its state before
applying the change. If so, increment the count by 1.
