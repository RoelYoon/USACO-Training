Ad-Hoc solution. O(n^2*k)

Observe that you can achieve the maximum number of yes queries by taking two cows which have
the most number of characteristics in common and taking out the common characteristics one 
by one until left with only unique characteristics, at which point you can ask one more query.

So we only need to find the maximum number of common characteristics between any two cows by
finding all pairs of cows (n^2) and going through their characteristic sets (size k).
