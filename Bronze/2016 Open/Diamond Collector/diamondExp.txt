Ad-hoc solution. O(n^2)

Sort the sizes, then iterate through each diamond and figure out how many diamonds larger than
itself has a difference of <=k. Find the maximum among these counts.

Feels similar to the naive string-search algorithm. Could probably be optimized to O(n) by 
eliminating parts that are re-counted.
