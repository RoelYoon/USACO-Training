Math (basic geometry) solution. O(n*logn) (could be done in linear time without sorting)

Find the primary extrema cows (right-most, left-most, highest, lowest) then the secondary 
extrema cows (second right-most, second left-most, etc.). I did this by sorting the cows
then accessing the ends of the sorted vector, but a simple linear traversal or possibly 
two linear traversals with a little bit of logic could find all these extrema points in 
linear time. 

After finding these extrema points, simulate removing each of the primary extrema cows and 
replacing it with the secndary extrema cow, and find the minimum of the resulting areas.
