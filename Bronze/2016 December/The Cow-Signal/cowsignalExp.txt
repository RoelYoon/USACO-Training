Simulation solution. O(n*m*k^2)

Simulate expanding the signal k units both horizontally and vertically.
Essentially, for every "pixel" of the original signal, copy the pixel to a k*k 
area in the output signal.

This effect can be achieved by simply keeping a separate set of row and column 
pointers to the original signal pattern that iterate k times as slow.
