Brute force solution. O(n^2*m).

Observe that if there are any shared characters at any base position between the spotty and plain cows, 
then that base position could not explain spottiness by itself. 

So, at every position (m), match every character from the spotty genomes to every character from the plain genomes
and check if there are any overlaps (n^2 process). Count how many positions pass this check.

Time complexity could be optimized to O(n*m) using hashtables.
