Ad-hoc solution. O(n^2)

For every color, find its largest original rectangle. Then, iterate through the "pixels" of the
theoretical rectangle and note any colors that are not the current color in this rectangle. 
Observe that these detected colors could not have been the first to be painted because they are blocking 
some other rectangle.

Count how many colors are possible candidates after doing the process above.
