Sweep line/greedy solution. O(n)

Create a timeline of events where an event is of the following form:

struct Event{
    int time;
    bool isStart; 
    int b;
}

The "isStart" attribute reprents whether the event indicates a start of a cow's milking session
or the end of a cow's milking session.

The "b" attribute represents the number of buckets needed by the cow with which the event is 
associated. 

Sweep through this timeline and follow the following greedy algorithm:

if(event is end){
    numberOfFreeBuckets += event.b;
}else{
    if(event.b > numberOfFreeBuckets){
        totalBucketsUsed += (event.b-numberOfFreeBuckets);
        numberOfFreeBuckets = 0;
    }else{
        numberOfFreeBuckets -= event.b;
    }
}
