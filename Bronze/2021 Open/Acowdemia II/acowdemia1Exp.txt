Greedy solution. O(n^2*k).

For every entry:
Iterate through the entry left to right. Any time the alphabetical ordering is broken, 
flag that point as lastBroken. For every cow during the regular traversal, do a reverse 
traversal from the current lastBroken to the beginning of the entry where you mark the 
current cow as the senior to every cow in this reverse traversal.
