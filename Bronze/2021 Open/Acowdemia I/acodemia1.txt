Greedy solution. O(n).

Followed this very simple algorithm:
- sort
- traverse greatest to least while incrementing h every iteration
- keep iterating until we find some c_i which is less than the current h.
From this index, traverse through all the past c values and try incrementing any which are
less than the current h (if they have not been incremented before). 
If any c values are still less than h after this or we run out of additional citations we can make
(L) before incrementing all lower c values, the current h is the limit.
