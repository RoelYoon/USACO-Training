DP / Brute force solution. O(n^2).

Observe that when given the sequence b_1, b_2, b_3... b_{n-1}, the value of a_i for any i<n is
b_{i-(1-(i%2))} - a_{i-1}. This means given just a_1, you can calculate all other a values in
O(n). 

So simply iterate through all possible values of a_1 in lexicographical order and print the first
possible permutation.
