Greedy simulation solution. O(n^4)

Take the greedy approach of always flipping the farthest tipped cow from the upper-left corner until no 
cows are tipped. Count how many times a flip is performed.

We have to get to all tipped cows eventually, and cows farthest from the upper-left corner affect the 
most cows, possibly messing up any corrections, so it is logical that we must flip the farthest cows 
first before making any corrections in other cows.
