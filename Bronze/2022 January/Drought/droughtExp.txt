Greedy solution. A rough worst-case time complexity analysis is O(n*max(h_i)), but in average cases
is around O(n).

Keep track of the minimum h, minH. Iterate through all h values and if h_i > minH, apply the 
operation of decreasing h_i and h_{i+1} by d where d = h_i - minH. At any point if any h value
becomes less than minH, replace the old minH and set the newMinSet flag variable. If this flag
is set at the end of the traversal, restart the traversal using the same algorithm. If any h
values become negative at any point, the case is impossible.
